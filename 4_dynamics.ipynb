When a new contact is created, the velocity of the contact normals should be nullified to render physic. You can do that by *projecting the current velocity in the null space of the normal jacobian of the new contacts*. Ideally, this projection should be done while respecting the Gauss principle, but that is a little bit too advanced for the purpose of this notebook.\n",
